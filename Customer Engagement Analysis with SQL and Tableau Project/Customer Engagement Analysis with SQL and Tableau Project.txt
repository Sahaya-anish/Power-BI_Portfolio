Case Description
Overview: Our Customer Engagement Analysis with SQL and Tableau project offers an exceptional opportunity to enhance and expand your professional portfolio. Your task is to build a three-page dashboard including key metrics and visualizations that aims to show student engagement with the 365 platform and identify critical areas of improvement. 

Objective: The following is a list of the questions we want our dashboard to answer:

1) Which courses are the most watched by students, and how are they rated?
2) How many students register each month, and what fraction are also onboarded?
3) How do students engage with the platform (minutes and average minutes watched) based on student type (free-plan or paying)?
4) Do students watch more content with time, and does it vary seasonally?
5) Which countries have the most students registered, and does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
	Discuss your findings, uncover valuable insights, and gain meaningful experience working on a real-life database.
